# SCENARIO – Coding Focussed

Nurse Joy is overwhelmed with the number of patients that are turning up to the
Palet Town Hospital. She generally uses a note pad to jot down the name of the
patient, age, height, weight, gender, phone number, address, email, injury type
and urgency (!, !!, !!!). But she can’t keep up with the number of people coming
in! So, she hires a programmer to whip up a system for her to easily place in
and access all the information that she would usually write on the notepad.

So, it’s up to you as the programmer to design a website system that will aid
Nurse Joy and the citizens of Palet Town.

## Criteria

Your solution should include the following:

- Ability to take and edit inputs, including:
  - Patient first name
  - Patient last name
  - Patient age
  - Patient height and weight
  - Patient gender
  - Contact information (phone number, email)
  - Injury type
  - Urgency (use the given criteria for this)
  - Note that if a patient has multiple injuries over a course of time, this
    should all be added to the same profile OR have an element which allows for
    their name to be searched up.

- Save the above information to a centralised data base/file which can only be
  accessed by authorised user
  - For authorisation, this can be done in two ways:
    - Make it only able to accept a certain criterium (if so, please submit the
      username and password alongside your main submission)
    - User is able to make an account
  - Have an alert system for each classification through having separate lists
    for each urgency criteria that are posted on the website
  - Any other additions are welcome!

## What are we looking for when marking?

- Use and understanding of code elements/logic: /10
- Website Organisation: /10
- Simplicity for user/UI experience (easier to use, the better): /10
